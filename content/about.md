# About Me

I'm a Moroccan-American software engineer from Aurora, Colorado. My name—Badr (بدر)—means "The Full Moon" in Arabic.

In becoming a professional engineer, I've found that I really enjoy learning new things and having to struggle through a
problem to solve it. I've been starting to learn Go, developing small applications with it. I've been continuing to grow my knowledge
of Docker and Kubernetes and am studying to take the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam.

I'm  actively looking for a new role where I can continue developing my skills, particularly in Developer Operations
or Platform Engineering. Ideally, I'm looking for a company with a mature remote working culture that strikes the right
balance between flexibility and productivity. As a young professional, I'm passionate about continuous learning and
growth, and I'm excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in a new, challenging environment.

One of the things I've struggled with as a developer is "knowing what I know." To help with this, and so I’ve decided to try to use
this website as a way to document and write about the things I’m learning.

## What about When I'm Not Writing Code

When I'm not writing code, I like to drink coffee, read a book, and hang out with friends. When I need to clear my head,
I go for a run or listen to music. For about two years, I've been running much more seriously and started to sign up for
more events. This year, I'll be running my first last-person standing event, in Ouray, Colorado. And, when I can, I'd like to
run the Marrakech Marathon.
