## About Me

I’m a Moroccan-American software engineer from Aurora, Colorado. My name—Badr (بدر)—means “Full Moon” in Arabic.

In becoming a professional engineer, I’ve found that I really enjoy learning new things and having to struggle through a problem to solve it. I’ve been starting to learn Go, developing small applications with it. I’ve been continuing to grow my knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes and am studying to take the Certified Kubernetes Administrator exam.

I’m actively looking for a new role where I can continue developing my skills, particularly in Developer Operations or Platform Engineering. Ideally, I’m looking for a company with a mature remote working culture that strikes the right balance between flexibility and productivity. As a young professional, I’m passionate about continuous learning and growth, and I’m excited about the opportunity to apply my skills in a new, challenging environment.

One of the things I’ve struggled with as a developer is “knowing what I know.” To help with this, I’ve decided to try to use this website as a way to document and write about the things I’m learning.
