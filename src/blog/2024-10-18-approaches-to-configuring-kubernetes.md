These are my notes on Kubernetes, comparing the imperative and declarative approaches to configuring a basic set of objects for a cluster.

## Imperative Approach

Kubernetes provides two primary methodologies for managing and configuring resources: imperative and declarative.

The imperative approach focuses on executing individual commands to directly manage resources within the Kubernetes
cluster. This method is straightforward and immediate, allowing users to create, update, or delete resources by issuing
commands in real-time. However, this can lead to challenges in tracking the state of resources, especially in larger
deployments where multiple commands might be required to achieve the desired configuration.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Immediate Action**: Users issue commands that lead to immediate changes in the cluster state.
- **Less Automation**: Requires manual intervention for updates and maintenance.
- **State Management**: Harder to maintain a consistent view of the desired vs. actual state of resources, leading to
	potential discrepancies.

### Example:

To create a deployment using the imperative approach, a user might run:

```shell
kubectl create deployment my-app --image=my-image
```

This command directly creates a deployment for `my-app` using the specified image. Each action must be explicitly
invoked, which can become tedious and error-prone as the number of resources grows.

## Declarative Approach

In contrast, the declarative approach emphasizes defining the desired state of the system in configuration files.
Instead of executing individual commands, users write YAML or JSON files that describe the desired state of Kubernetes
objects. When these configuration files are applied to the cluster, Kubernetes takes responsibility for making the
actual state match the desired state. This method allows for greater consistency, easier tracking of changes, and
improved automation capabilities.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Desired State Definition**: Users describe what they want the cluster to look like (e.g., deployments, services,
	etc.) in a declarative format.
- **Automation and Reconciliation**: Kubernetes continuously monitors the cluster and reconciles the current state with
	the desired state defined in the configuration files.
- **Version Control**: Configuration files can be stored in version control systems, making it easier to track changes
	over time and roll back to previous configurations if needed.

### Example:

To create or update a deployment using the declarative approach, a user would create a configuration file (e.g.,
`config.yaml`) and apply it with a single command:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image
```

 The command to apply the configuration is:

 ```shell
 kubectl apply -f config.yaml
 ```

In this example, Kubernetes will ensure that three replicas of `my-app` are running with the specified container image.
If the configuration is updated in `config.yaml`, running the `kubectl apply` command again will update the deployment
to match the new desired state.

## Conclusion

Understanding the differences between imperative and declarative approaches is essential for effectively managing
Kubernetes resources. While the imperative approach allows for quick, on-the-fly adjustments, the declarative approach
provides a more structured and manageable method for ensuring that the cluster's state aligns with the defined
configurations. For most use cases, especially in production environments, adopting a declarative approach is
recommended for its advantages in automation, tracking, and consistency.
